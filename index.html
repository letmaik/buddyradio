	<h2>What it does</h2>
	<p>
		BuddyRadio is an extension to <a href="http://grooveshark.com">Grooveshark</a> and adds
		a new sidebar section on the left side of it. There you can add your friends (or other users) from 
		<a href="http://last.fm">Last.fm</a> and see when they are listening to music. If they are,
		you can tune into their live listening stream by clicking their user name. You can also 
		tune into the past, that is choose some day of last week and play the music your friends
		listened to at that day.

    <h3>Greasemonkey</h3>
	<p>
		If you want to use BuddyRadio each time you visit <a href="http://grooveshark.com">Grooveshark</a>
		then you should install it as a 
		<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/">Greasemonkey</a> Script.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/source/117237.user.js">Download Greasemonkey Script</a> (tested on Mozilla Firefox)
	</p>
	
	<h3>Bookmarklet</h3>
	<p>
		If you want to test BuddyRadio first or just use it occassionally, it might be better to
		use the Bookmarklet version which also runs in every browser.

	<h2>FAQ</h2>
	<h3>Where can I submit issues and suggest new features?</h3>
	<p>
		Please jump over to the <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/117237">BuddyRadio userscripts.org site</a>. There you can discuss,
		submit issues, write reviews and even become a fan ;-)
	</p>
	<h3>Do I need to re-download the scripts to get updates?</h3>
	<p>
		No! The script you download is just a very small one (like a boot loader) which loads
		its main application from a dedicated server each time you run BuddyRadio. Therefore
		you automatically always use the latest available version and don't have to worry about it.
	</p>
	<h3>Why are my settings and users not there anymore?</h3>
	<p>
		BuddyRadio uses the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/webstorage/">local storage</a>
		of your web browser and doesn't save anything on remote servers. Therefore, if you
		use another device or reinstall your browser, that data will be lost. To make a fresh start
		easier, BuddyRadio has a built-in function to load all your Last.fm friends at once. (click "+")
	</p>
	<h3>Why does the music sometimes stop for some seconds on a song change?</h3>
	<p>
		Sometimes when BuddyRadio tries to add a new song to Grooveshark's playlist, it doesn't work.
		With the limited <a href="http://developers.grooveshark.com/docs/js_api/">Javascript API</a>
		(see question below) there is no way to detect whether this has happened (before the song ends).
		If it could be detected (by having access to the whole playlist queue) BuddyRadio could
		immediately try again to add the new song to the playlist. So instead, what happens is, the current song
		ends and BuddyRadio can now detect that there should be something new playing now, but in fact there isn't.
		Then, it can try to add the song again one more time. That's why there is a slight delay in some cases.
	</p>
	<h3>What the hell is http://buddyradioproxy.appspot.com??</h3>
	<p>
		If you look at the source code or observe your web traffic you will see requests to
		http://buddyradioproxy.appspot.com/tinysong. This is a simple wrapper to the 
		<a href="http://tinysong.com/api">Tinysong API</a> I had to create as it's not allowed to
		publish your personal Tinysong API key (e.g. as part of the source code of BuddyRadio).
		Tinysong is owned by Grooveshark and is used in BuddyRadio to find songs in Grooveshark. This is
		needed because Grooveshark's <a href="http://developers.grooveshark.com/docs/js_api/">Javascript API</a> 
		doesn't support any searching.
	</p>
	<h3>Why wasn't BuddyRadio developed as an extension to Last.fm?</h3>
	<p>
		First, Last.fm doesn't allow to stream music using their public API. Second, many songs on
		Last.fm are only available as a 30 sec version or not at all, particularly newer releases.
		Grooveshark on the other hand lets users upload any of their music and operates under the
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act">DMCA</a> like YouTube.
		So, you might ask, why not fetch songs from Grooveshark and somehow play them inside Last.fm?
		That's not possible either as Grooveshark isn't granting streaming API access to some small
		developer. What they do is provide <a href="http://developers.grooveshark.com/docs/js_api/">Javascript API</a>
		access while you're on their website. The BuddyRadio code base has been kept quite modular so that if
		any of the APIs change or even a different streaming site should be used, the effort should
		be quite low.
