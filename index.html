		BuddyRadio is an extension to <a href="http://grooveshark.com">Grooveshark</a> and adds
		a new sidebar section on the left side of it. There you can add your friends (or other users) from 
		<a href="http://last.fm">Last.fm</a> and see when they are listening to music. If they are,
		you can tune into their live listening stream by clicking their user name. You can also 
		tune into the past, that is choose some day of last week and play the music your friends
		listened to at that day.
	</p>

	<h2>How can I...</h2>
	<h3>... add Last.fm friends?</h3>
	<p>
		If you are using the new <a href="http://preview.grooveshark.com/">preview of Grooveshark</a> then
		BuddyRadio is under "My Music" on the bottom left of the pinboard. There you just click "Add...".
	</p>
	<div style="text-align:center">
		<img src="screenshot_add_menu_new_grooveshark.png" alt="Screenshot showing Add User menu" />
	</div>
	<p>
		If you use the normal / current version of Grooveshark then just click the "+" icon on the right side
		of the BuddyRadio header.
	</p>
	<div style="text-align:center">
		<img src="screenshot_add_menu.png" alt="Screenshot showing Add User menu" />
	</div>
	<p>
		<strong>Advice:</strong> Use the "Import my Last.fm Buddies" option to import all your Last.fm friends
		at once! Just enter your Last.fm name and click the button to start loading them.
	</p>
	
	<h3>... listen to live radio?</h3>
	<p>
		This is the easiest one. Just click on the name of the user!
	</p>
	<p>
		If your friend stops listening to music then your music will stop as well after all queued songs
		finished playing. It will restart again when your friend starts playing some music again.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Advice:</strong> If your friend isn't online, you can also listen to some of his songs of
		last week! (see below)
	</p>
	
	<h3>... listen to what my friend heard yesterday?</h3>
	<p>
		Click on the icon left to the user name. From there you can choose which day to listen to.
		You can close the menu by clicking on the icon again.
	</p>
	<div style="text-align:center">
		<img src="screenshot_more_menu_new_grooveshark.png" alt="Screenshot showing user menu" />
	</div>
	<p>
		At the moment you can only hear music of the last 7 days.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Advice:</strong> In the settings menu (see below) you can change how many songs are
		preloaded. This makes it easier to skip songs you don't like. This setting is only effective
		when listening to songs of past days.
	</p>
	
	<h3>... listen to multiple friends at the same time?</h3>
	<p>
		Just tune into as many friends as you like by clicking on them or using the user menu for songs
		from last week! The songs will then be mixed.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Advice:</strong> In the settings menu (see below) you can change how many songs of each user
		should be played in a row before songs of the next user are played.
	</p>
	
	<h3>... change some settings?</h3>
	<p>
		When you hover over the BuddyRadio heading a settings link will appear which you have to click to
		open the settings menu. In the new version of Grooveshark you just click the "Settings" link as shown
		in the screenshot.
	</p>
	<div style="text-align:center">
		<img src="screenshot_settings_menu.png" alt="Screenshot showing settings menu" />
	</div>
	<p>
		<strong>Info:</strong> All your settings and imported friends are saved locally in your web browser.
		You don't have to redo all steps next time.

	* IE9 and newer only. You also have to switch document mode to IE9 (Grooveshark has IE8 as default)
	</p>
	
    <h3>Greasemonkey</h3>
	<p>
		If you want to use BuddyRadio each time you visit <a href="http://grooveshark.com">Grooveshark</a>
		then you should install it as a 
		<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/">Greasemonkey</a> Script.

	<h3>Bookmarklet</h3>
	<p>
		If you want to test BuddyRadio first or just use it occassionally, it might be better to
		use the Bookmarklet version which also runs in every browser. (well.. soon will)

	<h2>FAQ</h2>
	<h3>Where can I submit issues and suggest new features?</h3>
	<p>
		Please jump over to the <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/117237">BuddyRadio userscripts.org site</a>. There you can discuss,
		submit issues, write reviews and even become a fan ;-)
	</p>
	<h3>Do I need to re-download the scripts to get updates?</h3>
	<p>
		No! The script you download is just a very small one (like a boot loader) which loads
		its main application from a dedicated server each time you run BuddyRadio. Therefore
		you automatically always use the latest available version and don't have to worry about it.
	</p>
	<h3>Why are my settings and users not there anymore?</h3>
	<p>
		BuddyRadio uses the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/webstorage/">local storage</a>
		of your web browser and doesn't save anything on remote servers. Therefore, if you
		use another device or reinstall your browser, that data will be lost. To make a fresh start
		easier, BuddyRadio has a built-in function to load all your Last.fm friends at once. (click "+")
	</p>
	<h3>Why does the music sometimes stop for some seconds on a song change?</h3>
	<p>
		Sometimes when BuddyRadio tries to add a new song to Grooveshark's playlist, it doesn't work.
		With the limited <a href="http://developers.grooveshark.com/docs/js_api/">Javascript API</a>
		(see question below) there is no way to detect whether this has happened (before the song ends).
		If it could be detected (by having access to the whole playlist queue) BuddyRadio could
		immediately try again to add the new song to the playlist. So instead, what happens is, the current song
		ends and BuddyRadio can now detect that there should be something new playing now, but in fact there isn't.
		Then, it can try to add the song again one more time. That's why there is a slight delay in some cases.
	</p>
	<h3>What the hell is http://buddyradioproxy.appspot.com??</h3>
	<p>
		If you look at the source code or observe your web traffic you will see requests to
		http://buddyradioproxy.appspot.com/tinysong. This is a simple wrapper to the 
		<a href="http://tinysong.com/api">Tinysong API</a> I had to create as it's not allowed to
		publish your personal Tinysong API key (e.g. as part of the source code of BuddyRadio).
		Tinysong is owned by Grooveshark and is used in BuddyRadio to find songs in Grooveshark. This is
		needed because Grooveshark's <a href="http://developers.grooveshark.com/docs/js_api/">Javascript API</a> 
		doesn't support any searching.
	</p>
	<h3>Why wasn't BuddyRadio developed as an extension to Last.fm?</h3>
	<p>
		First, Last.fm doesn't allow to stream music using their public API. Second, many songs on
		Last.fm are only available as a 30 sec version or not at all, particularly newer releases.
		Grooveshark on the other hand lets users upload any of their music and operates under the
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act">DMCA</a> like YouTube.
		So, you might ask, why not fetch songs from Grooveshark and somehow play them inside Last.fm?
		That's not possible either as Grooveshark isn't granting streaming API access to some small
		developer. What they do is provide <a href="http://developers.grooveshark.com/docs/js_api/">Javascript API</a>
		access while you're on their website. The BuddyRadio code base has been kept quite modular so that if
		any of the APIs change or even a different streaming site should be used, the effort should
		be quite low.
